# Counting-single-source-shortest-paths-CSE-246-
This is a mini-project that I have done after completing the Algorithm course, check out the "readme" for what is it about.

This program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the number of shortest path exists from a given source to destination. 
Shortest paths with similar cost/weight. Additionally prints the cost to reach the shortest path along with the route/nodes it used.
You can find sample inputs as comment inside the main file.
